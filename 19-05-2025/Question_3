// Q: 13
// Title:
// L1 - Debugging an Array and String Manipulation Program

// Problem Statement:
// You are given a program that manipulates an array of student names. However, there are several bugs in the code that need to be fixed. Your task is to debug the program and make sure it works correctly. The program should perform the following:

// Add a new student name at a specific position using splice.
// Check if a student's name exists in the array using includes.
// Convert the array of student names into a single string where names are separated by commas using join.
// The existing code is as follows:

// function manageStudents() {
//     let students = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];

//     // Add "David" at index 1
//     students.splice(1, 0, "David");

//     // Check if "Eve" is in the list
//     console.log(students.includes("Eve"));  // Should return false

//     // Convert the array to a string with names separated by commas
//     console.log(students.join(","));  // Expected: "Alice,David,Bob,Charlie"
// }

// manageStudents();

// Tasks:
// Fix any bugs in the code.
// Write test cases to ensure that adding, searching, and joining operations are working as expected.
// Ensure that the program works for different cases (e.g., adding at different positions, checking different names).



function manageStudents() {
    let students = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];

    students.splice(1, 0, "David");

    console.log("Is Eve in the list?", students.includes("Eve"));  

    console.log("Joined student list:", students.join(","));  

    console.log("Updated student array:", students);
}

manageStudents();
